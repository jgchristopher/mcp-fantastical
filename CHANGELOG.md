## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- Calendar access denied under Claude Desktop due to TCC attribution failure ([#6](https://github.com/aplaceforallmystuff/mcp-fantastical/issues/6)). The EventKit helper is now wrapped in an ad-hoc-signed `FantasticalHelper.app` bundle with its own `CFBundleIdentifier` and `NSCalendarsFullAccessUsageDescription`, AND launched via `open -W` rather than direct `exec`. The bundle alone isn't enough — when spawned as a child of node, TCC treats the unsigned node binary (common with nvm/Homebrew Node installs) as the "responsible process" in the attribution chain and auto-denies without ever prompting. Routing through LaunchServices (`open`) detaches the helper from node's chain so it becomes its own responsible process. On first run, users see a one-time system prompt attributed to "FantasticalHelper".

### Changed
- Native helper path moved from `dist/native/fantastical-helper` to `dist/native/FantasticalHelper.app/Contents/MacOS/fantastical-helper`.
- Helper writes JSON to a temp file via a `--output <path>` argument (rather than stdout) because `open -W` detaches stdio from the caller. The TypeScript wrapper creates a per-invocation temp dir and reads the result back.
- Native helper timeout raised from 10s to 30s to accommodate the first-run TCC prompt.
- Native helper failures now log to stderr instead of being silently swallowed.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- Native EventKit helper (`native/FantasticalHelper.swift`) for fast, reliable calendar access
- Fallback mechanism: tries EventKit helper first, falls back to AppleScript if unavailable
- Build script for native helper (`npm run build:native`)

### Fixed
- Calendar permission errors (-1743) when running in MCP subprocess contexts (#2)
- Timeouts on large calendars (3000+ events) due to slow AppleScript `whose` filters
- Stale repository references from old GitHub username (#1)

### Changed
- `fantastical_get_today`, `fantastical_get_upcoming`, `fantastical_get_calendars` now use EventKit by default
- Updated README with Full Calendar Access permission requirements and troubleshooting
